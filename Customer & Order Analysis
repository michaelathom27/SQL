--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID";

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
AND Product="iPhone";

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct feb.OrderID
, cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.OrderID=cust.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
AND OrderID IS NOT NULL;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product
, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
SELECT product
, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"
GROUP BY Product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product
, SUM(Quantity)
, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
AND orderID <> "Order ID"
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) AS customers
, AVG(price*Quantity) AS average_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
AND feb.Quantity >2;
